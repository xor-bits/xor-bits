I like to code stuff

 - [hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-os/hyperion), osdev for fun
 - [zig-kernel](https://github.com/xor-bits/zig-kernel), learning zig the most reasonable way, by making an os with it
 - [zap](https://github.com/xor-bits/zap), game script lang
 - [srs2dge](https://github.com/xor-bits/srs2dge), a game engine that I am planning to rewrite
 - some WGPU projects that aren't public

My favourite languages:

 - Rust
 - Zig
